# PowerShell Automation: Account Enable/Disable

## Project Overview
This project aims to reduce the workload of our IT team by automating the enable/disable process for user accounts. Many offboarding requests are scheduled weeks or months in advance, increasing the risk of missing critical deadlines and posing a potential security vulnerability.

To mitigate this risk, I have implemented an automated solution using PowerShell and Task Scheduler to ensure accounts are enabled or disabled on the specified dates for my IT team members.

> **Note:** This may not be the ultimate solution, but it will save time and enhance security in our IT environment.

## Folder Structure
The script and related files should be organized as follows:

```
\\ServerName\powershellscript\
    â”œâ”€â”€ csv\          # Stores CSV files for account actions
    â”œâ”€â”€ log\          # Stores log files for execution history
```

**File Path:** `\\myserver\Share\Active Library\IT\powershellscript`

---

## Task Scheduler Setup
The script is scheduled to run daily at **6:00 PM** using Windows Task Scheduler.

### Steps to Create a Task Scheduler Job
1. **Open Windows Task Scheduler**

2. **Configure the Trigger**
    - Set the execution time to 6:00 PM.

3. **Configure the Action**
    - Add the PowerShell script file path.
    - Set arguments as:
      ```
      -File "\\servername\share\powershellscript\Enable_Disable_byUPN_Auditlog.ps1"
      ```

## Functionality
This script automates the enabling and disabling user accounts based on predefined dates.

### Current Features
- **Enable/Disable Accounts** (does not modify group memberships or extended attributes yet; planned for the next version).

## Usage Instructions
1. **Update the CSV File**
   - When a ticket is received and the last working date is known, update the CSV file:
     ```
     \\myserver\powershellscript\csv\AD_Activation_Date.csv
     ```

2. **Define Actions & Dates**
   - Ensure both the action (`enable` or `disable`) and the corresponding date are filled in.
   - If an invalid or missing value is detected (e.g., `enable` action but a `dateDisable` value is provided), the script will not execute.

   **Example CSV Format:**

4. **Execution & Logs**
   - Once executed, the `status` column in the CSV file will update to `done`.
   - A log file will also be generated for record-keeping.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend functionality to manage **group memberships** and **extended attributes**.
- Improve error handling and logging mechanisms.
